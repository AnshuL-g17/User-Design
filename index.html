	<h3>So Now Lets Talk About My Interests!</h3>
	<h5 >Sports!!!!!!</h5>
	<p >I was into sports when I was a child. So its not like I was into soccer or basketball or any other thing particularly. It was like I wanted to be good at everything. So I started with cricket as my father already had some experience in the feild so I started with it. I started playing professionally for PBCA(Punjab Board Cricket Association). Then during my high school My swimmimg teacher wanted me to represent the school at state level competetions and so I did. But i also liked playing badminton and devoted some time to it and played the Zonal level Championship. I played Soccer for the school but I guess not much good for further competetion as didn't devoted much time to it. So that it about my sports XD. you must be thinking  Thats this guy hasn't left any kind of sport except for polo XD.</p>

	<h5 >Singing!!</h5>
	<p >Well even if my voice was bad XD. It didn't Stop me from singing. i really like to sing. Even if you won't ever hear me singing beacuse i don't sing in front of anyone. It's just a personal thingy. I do record sometime but will never expose it to anyone.</p>

	<h5 >Movies!!</h5>
